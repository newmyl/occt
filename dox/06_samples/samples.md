## Tutorial: Modelling a Bottle

The Qt programming tutorial teaches how to use Open CASCADE Technology services to model a 3D object. 
The purpose of the tutorial is not to explain all OCCT classes but 
to help start thinking in terms of the Open CASCADE Technology.

This tutorial assumes that  the user has experience in using and setting up C++. 
From the viewpoint of programming, Open CASCADE Technology is designed 
to enhance user's C++ tools with high performance modeling classes, methods and functions. 
The combination of these resources allows creating substantial applications.
